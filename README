This project IS cabal-install, with all its [hackage-]dependencies inlined
into one, bundled package, that only depends on libraries provided by GHC.

The only reason for this package is easier bootstrapping.
You probably shouldn't use it.

This package contains no original code, it's just a big merge
from cabal-install and its dependant libraries.

Licenses (all BSD3) and authors are provided in the original packages (on hackage).
